Chess bot that plays on [Lichess](https://lichess.org). You can challange it [here](https://lichess.org/@/joneca-bot).

### Learning sources
- [Coding Adventure: Chess AI, by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4ogK0MIzqk) for general ideas and concepts.
- [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) for
	- MiniMax Algorithm
	- NegaMax adaptation of MiniMax
	- Alpha Beta Pruning
	- Static evaluation functions, with piece-square tables
	- Quiescence Search
	- Opening Books
	- Endgame Tables

This bot still has lots of room for improvement, some of the changes I'm planning on making are:
- Finish implementing quiescence search
- Endgame tables
- Integrate with [Sunfish](https://github.com/thomasahle/sunfish) engine for better performance 
- Neural Network Based Evaluation Function
